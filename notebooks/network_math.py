    # What GDP Misses About Your State's Economy

    If someone asked you to rank the 50 states by economic importance,
    you'd probably reach for GDP. California, Texas, New York — the usual suspects.

    But what if that ranking is **systematically wrong about 40% of states?**

    GDP answers one question: *how much does this state produce?*

    There's a different question: *how does this state sit within the web of
    trade relationships across the country?*

    **Those are fundamentally different questions, and they need different math.**
    This notebook shows you why — with concrete examples you can explore yourself.

    ### The Kentucky Story

    Kentucky's GDP ranks **#28** — a modest, mid-tier economy at \$206 billion.
    But its network centrality ranks **#14**, placing it in the top quarter.

    Why? Kentucky is a manufacturing and logistics nexus: automobiles
    (Toyota's largest North American plant), bourbon, tobacco, and coal. It
    sits at the crossroads of I-65, I-64, I-71, and I-75. It trades heavily
    with Ohio (#4 in the network), Indiana (#10), Tennessee (#12), and
    Illinois (#6).

    **Its trading partners are themselves major hubs.** Think back to the toy
    example: Kentucky is like a spoke connected directly to Node A. That
    connection to the hub raises its importance — even though its own
    economy is mid-tier.

    This recursive relationship — importance flowing through connections — is
    exactly what network centrality measures and GDP cannot.

            ### The Peninsula Puzzle: Florida

            Its network prestige is #5 — roughly proportional.

            But here's the puzzle: Florida sits on **zero** of the shortest trade paths
            between other states. Of 51 states, 31 share this property — but Florida
            is the largest economy among them.

            Why? Geography. A peninsula has no through-traffic. Trade flows *into*
            Florida (consumer goods for 22 million residents), but the major corridors
            between other states bypass it entirely.

            In our toy example, Florida is a spoke connected to the hub — well-connected
            but not a *bridge*. If supply chains need to reroute, Florida has no
            alternative paths. It's a well-connected dead end.

            ## Why the Math Is Different

            ### GDP Is Addition. Centrality Is Multiplication.

            **GDP** sums up everything produced within a state. It's a tally. Each state's
            number is independent — California's GDP doesn't affect Kentucky's GDP.

            **Network centrality** works differently. Your score depends on the scores of
            the states you trade with. If Kentucky trades heavily with Ohio (a major hub),
            Kentucky's centrality goes up. If Ohio also trades with Texas (another giant),
            that *indirectly* raises Kentucky's centrality too.

            It's recursive: importance flows through the network.

            This is why GDP and centrality can diverge: **GDP captures what you produce on
            your own. Centrality captures who you're embedded with.**

            ### The Bridge vs the Hub

            There's a second kind of structural role that GDP misses entirely.
            **Betweenness** asks: does trade between *other* states have to flow
            through you?

            Only **20 of 51 states** have any betweenness at all. The entire
            network's shortest trade paths flow through just CA, TX, NY, PA, IL,
            and a handful of others.

            You can be a major hub (high prestige) without being a bridge (zero
            betweenness). Florida is the perfect example — prestige #5 but zero
            betweenness. Conversely, Massachusetts is GDP #11 and prestige #22
            (underperformer), but **betweenness #6** — it sits on critical trade
            routes even though its own trade volume is modest.
